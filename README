Requirements:
Make sure you have python installed.
On Linux or Mac, open a terminal and type "python" and
check if you get a python shell prompt. (Ctrl-D to exit)
On Windows, type cmd to open terminal and then try "python"
or python.exe

Usage:
First, make sure you have python in your shell path. It should already be on Linux and Mac.
On Windows, please follow instructions at https://realpython.com/installing-python/ to see if
you already have it installed and how to install it.

If you are not able to install python for some reason, use the alternative option described below.

1. Go to github.com/whitebrandy/CS200-Sp-2021 and click the "Fork" button at the right side of the screen.

2. Once you have a forked copy, clone it into your local system
   git clone git@github.com:yourusername/CS200-SP-2021
   where yourusername is your github username

3. cd into the newly cloned repo and create a new branch:
   cd CS200-SP-2021
   git checkout HEAD -b assignment

4. Add the repo referenced above as "upstream"
   git remote add upstream github.com/whitebrandy/CS200-Sp-2021

5. Make sure you have python installed and execute:
   python ./create.file.py "Your Name, no spaces please"

   This should create a file called "Yourname".txt with the current date and time in it.

6. Commit the changes to your local repo. Make sure you enter a meaningful commit message
   and in the description for the commit, write down the steps you will execute for this
   assignment.
   Also, please make sure to add a signed-off-by line.
   
   git add filename
   git commit -s
